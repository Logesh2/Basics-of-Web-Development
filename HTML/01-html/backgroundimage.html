            (in books) the integral part of the decimal represents the number 
           of the chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter 
           in order of magnitude. Thus in Whittaker and Watson's 1921 A Course 
           of Modern Analysis, chapter 9 is devoted to Fourier Series; within that 
           chapter §9.6 introduces Riemann's theory</p>
